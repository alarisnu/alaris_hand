This paper presents a new open-source mechanical design of a 6-DOF anthropomorphic ALARIS robotic hand that can serve as a low-cost design platform for further customization and utilization for research and educational purposes. The presented hand design employs linkage-based three-phalange finger and two-phalange adaptive thumb designs with non-backdrivable worm-and-rack transmission mechanisms.

The proposed open-source mechanical design of the robotic hand has been created using SolidWorks CAD software. The final assembled model is shown in Hand_final_version.SLDASM file.
